 AWSDataJack is a modular cloud attack simulator that demonstrates how attackers can exfiltrate data from common AWS services under real-world misconfiguration scenarios. It automates:
- S3 bucket enumeration and object exfiltration
- EBS snapshot listing and copying
- RDS snapshot discovery and download
- Optional exfiltration to remote endpoints (e.g., Dropbox)
